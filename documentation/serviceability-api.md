## Serviceability

This repository contains an example Serviceability API that meets the business requirements being documented by the MEF Ethernet Serviceability Project.

Serviceability provides an API to help determine if a particular service is available (or could be made available) via a particular medium (e.g. Fiber, HFC) at a particular location by a particular Seller. Serviceability also provides fluid transitions to the quoting and site survey processes. The result of a Serviceability Request is a Serviceability Response that contains Product Offerings (quotations) that the Buyer may order from the Seller.

The Endpoint Summary table describes each Serviceability API endpoint. Following the table is an example of each action at each endpoint, including sample request and response payloads.

Serviceability API is divided into a [Serviceability Request API](serviceability-request-api.md) and a [Serviceability Response  API](serviceability-Response-api.md)
