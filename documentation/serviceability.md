# Serviceability

Serviceability provides an API, schemas, and sample apps (reference implementations) to help determine if a particular service is available (or could be made available) via a particular medium (e.g. Fiber, HFC) at a particular location. But it doesn't stop there: serviceability also provides fluid transitions to the quoting and site survey processes.

## API

The API for serviceability are designed and documented in the [endpoints](../endpoints) directory and described in [Serviceability API](serviceability-api.md)

## Additional Documentation

Endpoint definitions are provided in the `/endpoints` directory of this repository.
